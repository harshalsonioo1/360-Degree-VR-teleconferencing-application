360- Degree video teleconferencing application. 

We developed an android application that can be downloaded in APK format and ran in any cell-phone. It allows users to play Live-streamed or pre-downloaded 360-degree VR videos using the native player of the app conected to any Google cardboard. Another way around, just play it on the cell-phone using our full-screen player.
